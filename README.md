Face Recognition Project

Overview
This project is a face recognition system that uses machine learning to identify and classify faces in images and real-time video streams. The model is built using Python libraries including face_recognition, OpenCV, NumPy, and scikit-learn. It leverages a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict faces.

Features
- Face Encoding and Labeling : Encodes images into face embeddings and labels them for training.
- Model Training : Uses KNN to train on encoded face data.
- Image Prediction : Predicts and labels faces in a given image file.
- Real-Time Face Recognition : Uses a live webcam feed to detect and recognize faces.
- Performance Metrics : Calculates precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy for the model.

Installation
